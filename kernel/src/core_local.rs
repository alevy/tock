/// This type wraps a core-specific value of type `T`. It precludes
/// access to the same value from different cores/threads, but allows
/// multiple _shared_ (`&`) references from the same core/thread.
///
/// It is [`Sync`] and thus appropriate for static allocations of values
/// that are not themselves [`Sync`].
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// static FOO: CoreLocal<Cell<usize>> = unsafe { CoreLocal::new_single_core(Cell::new(123)) };
///
/// fn main() {
///   FOO.with(|foo| foo.set(foo.get() + 1));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Single-thread synchronization
///
/// Though there is no potential for races across cores, it is
/// possible for code on the same core to get multiple, shared,
/// references. As a result, users must use other synchronization
/// primitives (e.g. [`Cell`](core::cell::Cell),
/// [`MapCell`](tock_cells::map_cell::MapCell),
/// [`TakeCell`](tock_cells::take_cell::TakeCell) to allow obtaining
/// exclusive mutable access.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// Creators of a [`CoreLocal`] must ensure that they are only
/// accessible from contexts that meet the requirements of the
/// [`CoreLocal`] implementation used. See constructors (`new_*`
/// functions) for details on safety requirements.
